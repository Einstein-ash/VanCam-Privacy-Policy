        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 10 SEP, 2024</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Van Cam is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your personal information when you use our application that integrates with Google OAuth and Google Photos. The app allows users to manage their Google Photos library, including creating albums and uploading photos. The core feature of Van Cam is the ability to capture photos directly through the app and store them in specific albums chosen by the user, ensuring that only the user has control over their data.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>- <strong>Google Account Information:</strong> When you log in using Google OAuth, we collect basic information from your Google account, such as your name, email address, and profile picture. This information is used solely for authentication and personalization of the app experience.</p>
        <p>- <strong>Google Photos Data:</strong> We access your Google Photos library to allow you to create albums, upload images, and view photos. All actions performed within the app are controlled by the user, and the app does not modify or delete any content unless you explicitly request it. The developer does not have access to your data.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>- <strong>Authentication:</strong> We use Google OAuth to authenticate and securely log you into the app. This ensures that only you have access to your Google Photos account through Van Cam.</p>
        <p>- <strong>App Functionality:</strong> The app uses your Google Photos data to enable its core features, such as creating albums, uploading/viewing images, and capturing photos directly to a selected album. All of these actions are user-initiated, and the app does not store or access your data beyond what is necessary to provide these features.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Security and User Control</h2>
        <p>Your data security and privacy are our top priorities. The app operates with the following principles:</p>
        <p>- <strong>User Control:</strong> All data related to your Google Photos account is fully controlled by you. Van Cam does not have any backend access to your data; all interactions with your Google Photos library are directly between your device and Google’s servers.</p>
        <p>- <strong>Security:</strong> We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security. Van Cam does not store any of your personal data on its own servers.</p>

        <h2>5. Sharing Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties. The only sharing that occurs is between your device and Google’s servers for the purpose of interacting with your Google Photos account. Your data remains under your control, and you can revoke the app’s access to your Google account at any time.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have full control over your data. You can revoke access to your Google account and remove Van Cam's access to your Google Photos data at any time via your Google Account settings. No data is stored by Van Cam, and once access is revoked, the app will no longer be able to interact with your Google Photos library.</p>

        <h2>7. Unique Feature of Van Cam</h2>
        <p>Van Cam offers a unique feature that allows you to open an album within the app, activate your camera, and instantly capture photos that are directly stored in the selected album. This feature streamlines the process of organizing and adding photos to your Google Photos library, while ensuring that only you have access to these photos. The app does not retain any copies of the photos you capture; they are stored directly in your Google Photos account.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by updating the effective date above. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.</p>
